## Visual Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes:
Index page

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-index-wireframe.png" style="background-color: black" alt="index wireframe">
</div>

Classes page

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-classes-wireframe.png" style="background-color: black" alt="classes wireframe">
</div>

Contact page

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/contact-wireframe.png" style="background-color: black" alt="index wireframe">
</div>

Contact form

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-contact-form-wireframe.png" style="background-color: black" alt="contact form wireframe">
</div>

Register form

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/register-form wireframe.png" style="background-color: black" alt="register form wireframe">
</div>

### Fonts

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-font.png" alt="Fonts">
</div>

--primary-font: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
Is bold and a favourite for headings. It has very strong geometric values, with curves in the lettering not too tight making it more accessible for people with reading difficulties. ie. dyslexic readers.

--secondary-font: "Varela", sans-serif;
Modern, clean and minimalists making good contrast with the primary font yet still being in the same family, boasts the same accessibility
for people with reading difficulties. ie. dyslexic reader. Applied to <p> text.

### Icons

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-icons.png" alt="Icons">
</div>

- Icons are taken from the [Bootstrap](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- As they are utilised as classes, they can easily be styled using other classes or IDs in the same tag. I used Bootstrap classes to style them uniformly.
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social account icons and are styled with a hover over animation and colored for high contrast, readability against the footer.

### Colors

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readmecolorpallet.png" alt="Color Pallette">
</div>

- Using a lifestyle photo with a color picker to determine the main color pallet. Blues and greens for health and nurturing impact as per the company branding.
- primary-color: #1f2226; /_ Blue Fantastic _/ A dark blue for a clean dark backdrop
- secondary-color: #cfe0f4; /_light breeze _/ A high contrasting blue to compliment the dark backdrop.
- Transparent Teal: rgba(179, 255, 241, 0.6) used for text to ensure readability against the image back ground and good contrast with the blue pallet so the site is not too monotonal.
- Bootstrap buttons blue rgba (13,110,253) kept as provides a bold blue contrast, making it stand out whilst still being complimentry to the color pallet.

### Images

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-lifestyleimages.png" alt="Lifestyle Images">
</div>

- sourced from [istockphoto](https://www.istockphoto.com/).
- Used for carousel, service cards, classes and site photo.
- Chosen for color use, a lot of cool blues and greens.
- Chosen for diveristy and a heavy focus on clean & professional look.

Background image:

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/readmeassets/readme-background image.png" alt="Background Image">
</div>
- Gym machines in daylight chosen for color and branding, provides a good contrast with the deep blues.
- Blurred chosen to not intefere with the foreground content.

### Styling

- For this project I have utilised Bootstrap 5 classes and custom CSS to set primary and secondary colors accross the site making for easy updates.
- Transparent Teal backgrounds used for most pages in order for background image to blend but still have high contrast for readability.
- Transparent Black background used for text and CTA in the carousel to avoid color clashing with the image.
- Transparent Teal exception is with the contact page, as the Teal will clash with the googlemap feature .
- Bootstrap classes used for service layouts and CTA buttons making for easier stacking for each device.
